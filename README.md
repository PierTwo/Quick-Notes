# Quick Notes

## Description

This project is a Heroku deployed web app that allows the creation of quick and easy notes with a title and text that is able to be saved and deleted.

- I built this project to challenge myself by putting the backend skills I have been learning to use.
- This project solves needing a way to write a quick and easy note that you can save and then delete when you no longer need it.
- I learned a lot about how I can route my app's backend and use it to interact with the frontend of the web app in order to increase the functionality of any web apps I build.
